  - Language Revitalization
summary: "ChatGPT demonstrates considerable proficiency in handling various languages; however, I chose to focus on the Hawaiian language due to noticeable deficiencies in its responses. This study utilized beginner Hawaiian material from 'Ka Lei Haʻaheo' to assess the model's proficiency with simple sentences, using language translation and grammaticality judgments for evaluation. Key questions included identifying common errors, comparing them to typical learner mistakes, and understanding patterns or trends in these errors. The findings highlighted how these errors mirror and contrast human learning patterns, providing insights into improving AI-generated Hawaiian language content. Future steps involve using Hawaiian language newspapers to build and inform a model that aids in language revitalization and enhances AIʻs Hawaiian language capabilities for the purpose of education."

Experiment Summary: Understanding Hawaiian Language Nuances with AI
Objective:
To evaluate the ability of AI, specifically ChatGPT, to correctly differentiate between the Hawaiian definite articles "ke" and "ka," and to assess its understanding of Hawaiian pronouns and possessives.

Procedure:
Curate Beginner Sentences: Selected sentences that beginners in Hawaiian might encounter.
Provide Correct Translations: Ensured accurate Hawaiian translations for reference.
Create Comparative Sentences: Developed sentences for comparison to test AI responses.
Request Evaluation from AI: Asked ChatGPT to evaluate the sentences.
Analyze Responses and Note Trends: Analyzed the AI's responses for accuracy and consistency.
Draw Conclusions and Recommendations: Identified areas of strength and improvement for the AI.
Key Areas Tested:
Ke vs. Ka Usage:

KEAO Rule: Nouns starting with K, E, A, O should be preceded by "ke" (e.g., ke kumu).
Exceptions: Some words like "mele" (song), "puna" (spoon), and "pākaukau" (table) use "ke" despite not following the KEAO rule.
Evaluation: Created 20 unique prompts and tested each 5 times to account for potential AI variations.
Pronouns (Inclusive vs. Exclusive):

Tested AI's understanding of inclusive (kākou) vs. exclusive (mākou) pronouns.
Noted errors that mirrored common human mistakes, such as confusion between "mākou" and "kākou."
Found inconsistencies in the AI's interpretation of "ʻo ia" as "ʻoia."
Possessives (Koʻu vs. Kaʻu):

K-Possessives (koʻu): Used for things beyond personal control.
K-Less Possessives (kaʻu): Used for things within personal control.
Evaluated AI's ability to distinguish and correctly apply these possessives.
Results:
Ke vs. Ka: The AI generally followed the KEAO rule but struggled with exceptions.
Pronouns: Better performance in distinguishing inclusive vs. exclusive pronouns but still prone to occasional errors.
Possessives: Inconsistent application of k-possessives vs. k-less possessives, highlighting areas for improvement.
Conclusions and Recommendations:
While ChatGPT demonstrates a solid understanding of basic Hawaiian grammar rules, it still exhibits errors that are common among human learners, particularly with pronouns and possessives.
Continued training with a focus on exceptions to grammatical rules and more nuanced usage of possessives is recommended to enhance the AI's proficiency.
