Over a 17-week period, I conducted an extensive land title research project that explored the genealogies of land ownership stemming from the Great Māhele, a critical juncture in Hawaiian history. Beginning with the 1929 indices of land awards, I traced the land history of my ancestor's kuleana, uncovering their original plot and identifying two additional grants. This work included translating foreign testimonies and surveyor notes from Hawaiian to English, allowing for detailed documentation of each plot's current and historic locations and ownership transitions over time.

To substantiate these findings, I obtained relevant Tax Map Key (TMK) numbers and sourced essential documents from the Hawaiʻi State Archives, Bureau of Conveyances, and Land Court. This in-person research ensured that my work remained authentic and complete.

My project also examined the Great Māhele's broader context—a pivotal 1848 event that introduced a hybrid legal system combining British, American, and Indigenous Hawaiian law. The Māhele's legacy is complex, impacting Hawaiian land rights and reshaping traditional views of land tenure and social hierarchy. To grasp this complexity, I conducted a thorough literature review, analyzing primary records alongside key secondary sources to better understand how this historical event is remembered and interpreted today.

As part of this work, I translated over 200 pages from the Puke Māhele (1848) and developed a digital, text-searchable index of Registered and Survey Division Maps. These resources, organized by ahupuaʻa, district, and island, are annotated with surveyor information, map dates, and case drawers, providing accessible information for future research. My background in computer science and prior experience in engineering allowed me to approach this task with precision, using Microsoft Excel (Version 16.87®) to streamline complex data management. link to Mahele book 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1876FzePEVjmadP03mp0H6uqfiomi3PXMkqhAqRK-_iE/edit?usp=sharing'

A major focus of my research is preserving the linguistic integrity of ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi. The translations I performed prioritized capturing semantic and idiomatic nuances, respecting the original meanings to support both the language’s conservation and accurate historical representation.

While the Great Māhele is often seen as a divisive event, my findings highlight its intricacy, challenging binary narratives and acknowledging a nuanced mosaic of contexts and consequences. These research experiences have deepened my dedication to uncovering suppressed histories and amplifying authentic narratives of Indigenous communities.
